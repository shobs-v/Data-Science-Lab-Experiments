Hypothesis testing allows us to state what level of confidence we want to have in some observation about our data, then, in testing that observation, determine whether or not we are satisfied that it is correct.\n\nAnother way of making this decision is to make it into a chart. For example, we could have randomly recomputed the mean of an increasing number of values in the dataset, and used that to determine how confident we are in our result. So for example, we'll take the mean of a single sample from the dataset; then the mean of two samples from the dataset; then three, and so on.

It's important to do because a computer can't \"look\" at a graph; we mortals can, be we still need it too sometimes, because the graph is oftentimes ambiguous, and sometimes we need to make a lot of decisions potentially very quickly without necessarily looking at all of the graphs.\n\nIn a future notebook we'll look at the intimately related concept of confidence intervals.
